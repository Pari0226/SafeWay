🚺 SafeWay – Women Safety Route Companion
=========================================

SafeWay is a smart navigation app designed to help users choose **safer travel routes** instead of just the shortest ones.  
It blends real-time routing with a multi-factor safety score and an SOS alert system — so you can travel with more confidence, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.
